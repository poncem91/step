          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hello! My name is Mafe and I am currently a STEP intern at Google. 
          I was born and raised in Lima, Peru and moved to the US about 6 years ago to pursue my college degree. 
          It wasn't until after I graduated from college that I discovered my passion for Computer Science and programming, 
          so I decided to go back to school to complete a second bachelors in Computer Science. 
          I just wrapped up my first year as a CS student and I am loving every minute of it!
          </p>
          <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, playing tennis, skiing or snowboarding, and hiking with my dog Arlo. 
          Arlo is a 4-year-old English Setter who enjoys eating, sleeping, eating, hiking, and sleeping.
          </p>
