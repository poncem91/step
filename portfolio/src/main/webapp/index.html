          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hello! My name is Mafe and I am currently a STEP intern at Google. 
          I was born and raised in Lima, Peru and moved to the US about 6 years ago to pursue my college degree. 
          It wasn't until after I graduated from college that I discovered my passion for Computer Science and programming, 
          so I decided to go back to school to complete a second bachelors in Computer Science. 
          I just wrapped up my first year as a CS student and I am loving every minute of it!
          </p>
          <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, playing tennis, skiing or snowboarding, and hiking with my dog Arlo. 
          Arlo is a 4-year-old English Setter who enjoys eating, sleeping, eating, hiking, and sleeping.
          </p>

                  <li>Simulates an Interactive Liberty Bell Game with a starting amount of money inputted by the user, deducts money spent and adds payouts to user's balance as user keeps playing, while letting user know the result of each round played. As each round ends, the user's current balance is printed and user is asked if they want to continue playing.
