      <!-- Introductoy Paragraphy -->
      <p>Hello! My name is Mafe and I am currently a STEP intern at Google. 
          I was born and raised in Lima, Peru and moved to the US about 6 years ago to pursue my college degree. 
          It wasn't until after I graduated from college that I discovered my passion for Computer Science and programming, 
          so I decided to go back to school to complete a second bachelors in Computer Science. 
          I just wrapped up my first year as a CS student and I am loving every minute of it!
